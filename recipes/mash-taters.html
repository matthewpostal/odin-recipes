    <h1>Mash Potatoes Recipe</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Potatoes: I use either Russet or Yukon Gold potatoes. Either will work great, just make sure they are relatively if not extremely FRESH (haven't been sitting in the pantry for a couple weeks--these are still okay for fries, but not mash). Never never never try to mash a red potato.</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Butter</li>
        <li>Sour cream</li>
        <li>Milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and wash the potatoes (unless using new potatoes in which case skins can optionally be left on). Cut into roughly equally-sized chunks/cubes (to speed cooking). Rinse the potatoes several times.</li>
        <li>Salt some water liberally, add the potatoes and heat to a boil.</li>
        <li>Boil until tender (I test with a fork on a bigger chunk).</li>
        <li>Drain thoroughly, transfer to a large mixing bowl, and allow to sit and steam uncovered by themselves for several minutes for the excess water to evaporate (nobody wants watery potatoes).</li>
        <li>Add just the butter (I'd estimate roughly 2-3 tablespoons for 3-4 potatoes, but again just to taste) and the salt. If your butter is salted, just a little, if not A LOT.</li>
        <li>Roughly mash the potatoes together with just the butter and salt with a potato ricer if you have one or I just use an electric mixer and they come out pretty smooth if they're cooked properly.</li>
        <li>Add a few heaping spoonfuls of sour cream (and probably some more salt) and mix/rice together.</li>
        <li>Finally, as the potatoes start to become finer slowly add milk (warmed up in the microwave if you don't want to cool your potatoes down!) while mixing until desired consistency is reached. Taste and add extra salt if necessary.</li>
    </ol>
