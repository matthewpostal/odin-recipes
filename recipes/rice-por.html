    <h1>Rice Porridge</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>½ cup of presoaked white rice</li>
        <li>3 cups of water to start, more if you want your congee to be thinner</li>
        <li>~12 inches work of spare ribs, sectioned into individual ribs</li>
        <li>Sliced ginger - as much as you want, this will help flavor the congee</li>
        <li>3 smashed garlic cloves or as much as you want, this will help flavor the congee</li>
        <li>Salt - optional</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Process</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Pre-soak your rice, this will help the rice expand and yield a smoother texture.</li>
        <li>Place the sectioned spare ribs, sliced ginger, smashed garlic, pre-soaked rice and water into a pot and start boiling.</li>
        <li>As it starts boiling, skim off the top to get rid of impurities.</li>
        <li>Once it reaches a healthy boil, turn the heat to low and simmer uncovered for at least 1 ½ hours. If it’s too thick, add more water, too thin, boil for a little while longer. The longer you boil, the more the rice will break down.</li>
        <li>Ladle into serving bowls and add your favorite toppings and condiments.</li>
    </ol>
